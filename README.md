From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-and-jquery?ref=lnav)

This project aims to use new skills in both Javascript and jQuery to create an Etch-a-Sketch clone, which I'm calling "Sketch-a-Sketch".

In this project, I was a bit confused how to start, but the first thing I did was set up a GitHub depository, and clone it to my local machine. This would allow me version control over the project.

Second, I set up the visual coding for the etch-a-sketch itself, using html and css.
